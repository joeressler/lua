# Holographic Training Suite for Roblox Clans
## This is a kind "training place" used very frequently in Group events by so-called "war clans" on roblox that usually use Roblox LinkedSwords or RayCastLaser guns to fight each other for ego points, when I was younger and played a lot of roblox and was involved in group culture I always was absolutely mystified by these things so I decided to code a simple modular one.




In order to use this holo system make sure that the following items are in the following places:

'holoEvents' folder must be in ReplicatedStorage
'holoService' folder must be in ServerScriptService
'mapStorage' and 'toolStorage' must be in ServerStorage
teams 'Team_1', 'Team_2', 'Trainees', and 'Trainers', must be in Teams

You may place as many tools as you'd like into 'gunStorage' and 'swordStorage', these will be all given with the 'gun' and 'sword' commands respectively

You may place your maps into folders with their names inside of 'mapStorage', but make sure to add its name to MainModule's 'maplist' array and that its 
Position values are correctly where you'd like it to be placed.
