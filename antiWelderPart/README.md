# This was my foray into the anticheat world. In Roblox, because the free market for models is not regulated very well, users used to LOOOVE putting "viruses" into peoples games, basically scripts that would replicate themselves into every little nook and cranny of the game and stay there, and then do some insidious thing like create a fire particle effect, or delete the world, or crash the game, and there was one in particular that I really hated and most of the free "Roblox Virus Removers" didn't catch: "WelderPart". This one bugged me so much since I liked using freemodel scripts to learn from, that I made my own script to banish it to the shadow realm any time it was in my games.
