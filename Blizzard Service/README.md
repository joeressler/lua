# This is definitely my lua code I'm most proud of, this had a ton of learning hurdles for me and I had a blast making it since I love snow. Every set period of time, a blizzard happens (I didn't make the code for the actual snowing and I didn't make the image for the frost vignette, I'm not that good, credit to stickmasterluke for the snow itself and credit to google images for the frost vignette image) and if you're outside for too long you start to get frostbite! However, you can go inside or take shelter under a tree or in a cave (SmoothTerrain compatible! this took hours away from my life!) to hide from the elements and warm up to start healing up.
